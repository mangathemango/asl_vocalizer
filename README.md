# ASL Vocalizer

The name of this project isn't officially deided yet lmfao.

This ASL Vocalizer is planned to be a mobile/web app that takes in a live footage of ASL (American Sign Language), turn it into text, and automatically shove it into a TTS.

Right now this is a very and i mean VERY bare prototype of the app - it just recognizes the location of your hand and like where each fingers are using MediaPipe. Maybe in the future, this can scale into an actual ASL vocalizer.
